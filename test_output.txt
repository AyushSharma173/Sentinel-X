  FINDINGS: Multiple venous collaterals are present in the anterior left chest wall and are associated with the anterior jugular vein at the level of the right sternoclavicular junction. Left subclavian vein collapsed (chronic occlusion pathology?). Trachea, both main bronchi are open. Calcific plaques are observed in the aortic arch. Other mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esoph...
  IMPRESSION: s:
 Multiple venous collaterals in the anterior left chest wall and collapsed appearance in the left subclavian vein (chronic occlusion?).  Thickening of the bronchial wall in both lungs.  Peribronchial reticulonodular densities in the lower lobes, minimal consolidations (infection process?).  Atelectasis in both lungs.  Thoracic spondylosis.

  FINDINGS: Multiple venous collaterals are present in the anterior left chest wall and are associated with the anterior jugular vein at the level of the right sternoclavicular junction. Left subclavian vein collapsed (chronic occlusion pathology?). Trachea, both main bronchi are open. Calcific plaques are observed in the aortic arch. Other mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esoph...
  IMPRESSION: s:

Peribronchial reticulonodular densities in the lower lobes, minimal consolidations (infection process?).  Atelectasis in both lungs.  Thoracic spondylosis.

- Narrative (Report):
  FINDINGS: Trachea and both main bronchi were in the midline and no obstructive pathology was observed in the lumen. In the non-contrast examination, the mediastinal could not be evaluated optimally. As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Calcific atheroma plaque was observed in the descending aorta. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. N...
  IMPRESSION: s:
 Emphysematous and passive atelectatic changes in both lungs.  Minimal thickening of the segmental bronchial walls of both lungs.  Nonspecific subpleural nodule in the posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe.  Cholelithiasis.  Minimal degenerative changes in bone structure.
