--- Report Content ---
Findings (503 chars):
Trachea and both main bronchi were in the midline and no obstructive pathology was observed in the lumen. In the non-contrast examination, the mediastinal could not be evaluated optimally. As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Calcific atheroma plaque was observed in the descending aorta. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. N...

- Narrative (Report):
  FINDINGS: Trachea and both main bronchi were in the midline and no obstructive pathology was observed in the lumen. In the non-contrast examination, the mediastinal could not be evaluated optimally. As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Calcific atheroma plaque was observed in the descending aorta. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. N...
  IMPRESSION: s:
 Emphysematous and passive atelectatic changes in both lungs.  Minimal thickening of the segmental bronchial walls of both lungs.  Nonspecific subpleural nodule in the posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe.  Cholelithiasis.  Minimal degenerative changes in bone structure.
