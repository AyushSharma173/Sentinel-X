  "clinical_information": "Not given.",
  "technique": "Non-contrast images were taken in the axial plane with a section thickness of 1.5 mm.",
  "findings": "Trachea and both main bronchi were in the midline and no obstructive pathology was observed in the lumen. In the non-contrast examination, the mediastinal could not be evaluated optimally. As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Calcific atheroma plaque was observed in the descending aorta. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Passive atelectatic changes were observed in the right lung middle lobe medial and left lung upper lobe inferior lingular segment. Emphysematous changes are present in both lungs. Segmentary-subsegmental peribrochial minimal thickening was observed in both lungs. A millimetric nonspecific subpleural nodule was observed in the posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe. No mass lesion-active infiltration with distinguishable borders was detected in both lungs. As far as can be seen within the sections; A millimetric stone was observed in the gallbladder lumen. Minimal degenerative changes were observed in the bone structure.",
  "impressions": " Emphysematous and passive atelectatic changes in both lungs.  Minimal thickening of the segmental bronchial walls of both lungs.  Nonspecific subpleural nodule in the posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe.  Cholelithiasis.  Minimal degenerative changes in bone structure."
