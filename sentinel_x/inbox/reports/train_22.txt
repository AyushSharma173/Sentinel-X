TECHNIQUE:
Non-contrast images were taken in the axial plane with a section thickness of 1.5 mm.

Postoperative changes are observed in the mediastinum. There are minimal calcific atheromatous plaques in the coronary arteries. Thoracic esophageal calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected.
