CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Not given.

TECHNIQUE:
1.5 mm thick non-contrast sections were taken in the axial plane.

FINDINGS:
An image of a catheter extending superiorly to the vena cava was observed. Trachea and lumen of both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and lumen of both main bronchi. Mediastinal structures were evaluated as suboptimal since the examination was unenhanced. As far as can be observed: Calibration of thoracic main vascular structures is natural. No dilatation was detected in the thoracic aorta. Heart contour size is natural. Pericardial thickening-effusion was not detected. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. No lymph node was detected in mediastinal and bilateral hilar pathological size and appearance. When both lungs are evaluated in the parenchyma window: Pleuroparenchymal sequelae increase in density and paracicatricial bronchiectasis were observed in the upper lobe of the right lung. An increase in pleuroparenchymal sequelae density was observed in the laterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung. A few calcified lymph nodes measuring 3.5 mm in diameter and 3 mm in diameter in the left lung were observed in the middle lobe and upper lobe of the right lung. Bilateral pleural thickening-effusion was not detected. Liver size increased. Other upper abdominal sections within the examination area are normal. Bilateral adrenal gland calibration was normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. No lytic-destructive lesion was detected in bone structures.

IMPRESSIONS:
 Sequelae changes in the right lung.  Calcified nonspecific parenchymal nodules in both lungs.  Hepatomegaly.
