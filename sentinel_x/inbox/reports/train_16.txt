CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Operated breast ca, control.

TECHNIQUE:
Non-contrast images were taken in the axial plane with a section thickness of 1.5 mm.

FINDINGS:
 The right breast was not observed secondary to the operation. Thickening of the skin in the operation site, and increases in density consistent with post-op sequelae changes in subcutaneous fat planes were observed. Surgical suture materials were observed in the operation site and right axilla. A mass lesion with distinguishable borders in the left breast, no lymph node in pathological size and appearance was observed in the left axilla. Trachea and both main bronchi were in the midline and no obstructive pathology was detected in the lumen. On the left, a catheter image extending to the port chamber and superior-right atrium junction of the vena cava and anterior chest wall was observed. In the non-contrast examination, the mediastinum was not evaluated optimally. As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Pathological lymph nodes were observed in the bilateral supraclavicular region, measuring 25x14 mm in size on the left and 12x10 mm in size on the right. Lymph nodes of 15x13 mm in pathological size and appearance were observed adjacent to the left subclavian artery and at the level of the left aortapulmonary window, the largest of which was adjacent to the left subclavian artery. In other parts of the mediastinum, lymph nodes with short axes less than 1 cm that did not reach pathological dimensions were observed. It is also present in previous examinations. No significant difference was detected. In both hemithorax, effusion measuring 16. In the left hemithorax, thickening of the posterior costal pleura is observed. It is stable. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Patchy ground-glass consolidations were observed in the right lung apex, anterior and posterior segments, and in the peripheral subpleural areas of the middle lobe, forming a crazy paving pattern. The findings described may be compatible with radiation pneumonia or Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory. Suspicious ground glass opacities are also observed in the peripheral subpleural areas of the left lung lingular segment. A few millimetric nonspecific parenchymal nodules were observed in both lungs. In the non-contrast examination, intra-abdominal solid organs and vascular structures could not be evaluated. Further testing is recommended. Destruction area compatible with metastasis was observed in the sternum corpus. PET-CT examination revealed that FDG uptake belonging to metastasis in the thoracic vertebral corpus was found in the patient, and no lytic-destructive lesion in favor of metastasis was detected in the vertebrae within the CT limits.

IMPRESSIONS:
 Postoperative sequelae changes in the operation site in the patient who was learned to have had right mystectomy and axillary curettage.  Pathological lymph nodes adjacent to bilateral supraclavicular, aortopulmonary, and left subclavian arteries; is stable.  Stable lymph nodes that do not reach pathological dimensions in other parts of the mediastinum.  Slightly increased pleural effusion in the right hemithorax, stable sequelae thickening in the left posterior costal pleura.  Patchy ground glass consolidations with crazy paving patterns in the peripheral subpleural areas of the upper and lower lobe of the right lung; the outlook may be compatible with radiation pneumonia or Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory.  Millimetric pulmonary nodules in both lungs; is stable.  Metastatic mass lesions thought to increase in number and size in both lobes of the liver, although optimal evaluation could not be made in the examination performed without IV contrast; Further examination is recommended.
