CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Headache, weakness.

TECHNIQUE:
Non-contrast images were taken in the axial plane with a section thickness of 1.5 mm.

FINDINGS:
Trachea, both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the lumen. The mediastinum could not be evaluated optimally in the non-contrast examination. As far as can be seen; Mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Aeration of both lung parenchyma is normal and no nodular or infiltrative lesion is detected in the lung parenchyma. Pleural effusion-thickening was not detected. Upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Density changes consistent with hepatosteatosis are observed in the liver parenchyma. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved.

IMPRESSIONS:
hepatosteatosis.
