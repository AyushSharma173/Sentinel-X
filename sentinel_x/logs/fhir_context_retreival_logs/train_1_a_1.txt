VISUAL FINDINGS (Trigger):
Multiple venous collaterals are present in the anterior left chest wall and are associated with the anterior jugular vein at the level of the right sternoclavicular junction. Left subclavian vein collapsed (chronic occlusion pathology?). Trachea, both main bronchi are open. Calcific plaques are observed in the aortic arch. Other mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; linear atelectasis is present in both lung parenchyma. Subsegmental atelectasis is observed in the right middle lobe. Thickening of the bronchial wall and peribronchial budding tree-like reticulonodular densities are observed in the bilateral lower lobes. Peribronchial minimal consolidation is seen in the lower lobes in places.

FINAL ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risk Adjustment: INCREASE
Critical Findings:
  - Possible history of VTE
  - Multiple antiplatelet medications
  - Risk of bleeding complications

Assessment:
The patient is a 71-year-old male taking Clopidogrel, Aspirin, and Prasugrel. The imaging findings suggest possible venous collaterals and a collapsed subclavian vein, potentially indicating a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The patient's INR is within the normal range (1.1951), and the aPTT is also normal. However, the patient is on multiple antiplatelet medications, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. Given the imaging findings and the patient's medication regimen, it is important to consider the possibility of a history of VTE and to monitor for any signs or symptoms of bleeding. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the underlying cause of the venous abnormalities.
